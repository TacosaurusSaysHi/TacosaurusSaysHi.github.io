# The Cozy Spot

## Welcome to the Cozy Spot! Here I compile wholesome content that could help you calm down and focus. Enjoy! ❤️ 

**Preparation 📋**

*Before you begin, it is best that you think about what conditions you may be in during your study. For this, I recommend:*

- **Taking care of other problems or responsibilities before studying.** Doing so helps you focus more on your schoolwork; thus helping to block out all forms of procastination.
- **Cleaning/organizing your study area.** This makes it easier to find your learning materials and requirements.
- **Having a snack/drink ready.** If you get hungry during study, you'd immeadiately have some food ready to eat.
- Preparing a **to-do list** helps organize your thoughts and clears any confusiuon.
- As a bonus, have the [**personal study playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjemlHEEbxNgTgK0D-aIU8Eho2Wia-pT) I once made for myself. 

**Natural Vibes 🌸** 

*Here are some photos I took of flowers found near our home. I hope you enjoy!*
